```typescript
function createThunkMiddleware<
  State = any,
  BasicAction extends Action = AnyAction,
  ExtraThunkArg = undefined
>(extraArgument?: ExtraThunkArg) {
  // Standard Redux middleware definition pattern:
  // See: https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-4-store#writing-custom-middleware
  const middleware: ThunkMiddleware<State, BasicAction, ExtraThunkArg> =
    ({ dispatch, getState }) =>
    (next) =>
    (action) => {
      // The thunk middleware looks for any functions that were passed to `store.dispatch`.
      // If this "action" is really a function, call it and return the result.
      if (typeof action === "function") {
        // Inject the store's `dispatch` and `getState` methods, as well as any "extra arg"
        return action(dispatch, getState, extraArgument);
      }

      // Otherwise, pass the action down the middleware chain as usual
      return next(action);
    };
  return middleware;
